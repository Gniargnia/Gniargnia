## Hi there 👋

I'm Jo, from Quebec, Canada. I'm passionate about physics, mathematics, computer science, and AI.  
I also have a background in civil engineering and carpentry.

I discovered programming a bit later in life while working in an environment where many workflows could be automated.  
I wrote some code with Copilot, but I quickly realized I wanted to truly understand how everything works under the hood.  
Even though I'm starting this journey in my mid‑30s, I'm fully committed to shifting my career toward computer science and giving it my all.
